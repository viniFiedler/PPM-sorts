# PPM Sorts 

### About
This project produces one .ppm for each step of the selected sorting algorithm.

Inspired by videos like [those ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MsTNqK3o_w&t=2775s&ab_channel=Musicombo).

Don't take this Repo too serious, its just a compile from my first year at college.
